This project implements four algorithms for solving the Minimum Set Cover problem, including:
- Branch and Bound (BnB) is in BnB.py
- Approximation Algorithm is in approx.py
- Random-Restart Hill Climbing is in hill.py
- Simulated Annealing is in SA.py

The executable is script.py
You can run it from the command line with:
python script.py -inst <filename> -alg [BnB|Approx|hill|annealing] -time <cutoff in seconds> -seed <random seed>

The generated file will be saved to ../output/{alg}
