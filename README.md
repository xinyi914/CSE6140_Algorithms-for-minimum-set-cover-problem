This is the project of my course CSE6140 computational science and engineering algorithms. The project is to use different algorithms for solving minimum set cover problem
which is an NP-hard problem. Four algorithms: Exact branch-and-bound-bound, Approximation algorithm, Simulated Annealing and Random Restart Hill Climbing are implemented and compared.

The report is shown in "CSE6140ProjectReport_Team31.pdf" and code is under code folder.
